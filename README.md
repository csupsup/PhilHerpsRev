Abstract: We surveyed herpetological publications in the Philippines from the period of 2002 to 2022 for a total of 423 papers. Following a similar review 20 years ago, we classified publications into five categories, including (1) Diversity and Distribution, (2) Taxonomy, (3) Ecology, (4) Phylogenetics and Biogeography, and (5) Conservation. In this paper, we examined temporal changes in publication trends focusing on the last two decades and compared them to those from the preceding 20 years (1982–2002). Additionally, we quantified gender and nationality gaps of first authors across the last two decades of publications. The number of publications per year has dramatically increased from 2–5 per year in the period of 2002–2006 to upwards of 30–40 per year publications in the period of 2020–2022. Of the 423 articles we reviewed, the number of papers was highest in frogs and lizards and lowest in turtles and crocodiles. A greater proportion of published studies focused on Diversity and Distribution (35%) and Ecology (26.5%) and the lowest proportion was Conservation (11.6%). Across the five taxonomic groups, the proportions of research theme publications were not equitable, with proportionally more taxonomic papers published on lizards than other groups. As a result, there were far more numerous new species of lizards described (72 new species) than snakes (9) and amphibians (14). Over the last two decades, we saw a temporal trend, involving increased use of molecular data in taxonomic papers. Our survey of the geographic distribution of herpetological inventories versus geographic distribution notes or new island records indicates that for some conspicuous gaps, where comprehensive herpetological inventories have not yet been provided, the increasing trend towards the publication of brief geographical notes has in part begun to ameliorate these geographical hiatuses. Our analysis of demographic gaps in first authorship indicates, whereas we see a near-perfect balance between the numbers of Filipino first authors versus first authorship by foreign collaborators (1.07:1), there remains a substantial gender gap between female first authors and their male counterparts (1:7.13). Nonetheless, the steep increase in publication activities, number, and kinds of people in Philippine herpetology is a remarkable positive finding compared to the preceding 20 years. Our hope is that the next two decades will bring increasingly equitable, internationally collaborative, and inclusive engagement in the study of amphibians and reptiles to an even greater diversity of the people in the Philippines.
