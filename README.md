Abstract: The first review conducted over two decades ago (year 2002) included the distinct periods which characterized the development and accomplishments of herpetological research in the Philippines up to the turn of the century. In this paper, we revisited that same general topic and re-assessed what Philippine herpetology has accomplished—both as a discipline and a community—over the last two decades. We compiled herpetological publications in the Philippines from the period of 2002–2022 for a total of 423 papers. We categorized papers by taxon (lizards, snakes, amphibians, crocodiles, turtles, and multiple taxa) and category: (1) Diversity and Distribution, (2) Taxonomy, (3) Ecology, (4) Phylogenetics and Biogeography, and (5) Conservation. We also quantified gender and nationality gaps of first authors across the last two decades of publications. There was a significant increase in publications over the years, from 2–5 publications per year in the period of 2002–2006 to upwards of 30–40 per year in the period of 2020–2022. Half of the published studies focused on squamate reptiles (lizards 30.5%, snakes 21%) and 28.4% on amphibians, 5.9% on turtles, and 2.6% on crocodiles. The remaining 11.6% of studies were conducted focusing on multiple taxa. Diversity and Distribution (35%) and Ecology (26.5%) studies remained popular while studies on Taxonomy (14.9%), Phylogenetics and Biogeography (11.8%), and Conservation (11.6%) were all on the rise. The categories of published studies across taxonomic groups were disproportionate, with more studies focused on diversity and ecology for both amphibians and snakes and taxonomic studies for lizards. And thus, many new species of lizards (n=72) were described over the last two decades, followed by amphibians (n=14) and snakes (n=9). Our survey of geographical patterns indicates that for some regions where comprehensive herpetological inventories have not yet been provided, the increasing trend towards the publication of brief distribution notes has partly begun to ameliorate these geographical gaps. Finally, we found a near-perfect balance between the numbers of Filipino first authors versus first authorship by foreign collaborators (1.0:1.1), although there remains a substantial gender gap between female and male first authors (1.0:7.1). Nonetheless, the steep increase in publication activities, number, and diversity of people in Philippine herpetology is a remarkable positive finding compared to the preceding 20 years. Our hope is that the next two decades will bring increasingly equitable, internationally collaborative, and inclusive engagement in the study of amphibians and reptiles in the Philippines.
